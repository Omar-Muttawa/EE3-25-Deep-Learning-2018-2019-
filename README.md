## Abstract

This repo evaluates the use of different Deep Neural Network architectures in Image representation. This is done by evaluating different model architectures ability to describe noisy patches from the NH-Patches data-set into 128x1 description vectors which are used to represent the patch and differentiate itself from other patches. Firstly a baseline model using two separate CNNs for denoising and describing is analyzed for its performance on the three de- fined bench marks included with NH-Patches; Verification , Matching and Retrieval , after which a proposed approach formulated by the analysis and improvement of said base- line is outlined and subsequently evaluated.
